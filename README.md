# Project Name

This project implements a Real-Time Physical Threat Detection System that leverages python to detect potential physical threats from real-time video streams. The system is designed to process RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) streams, making it compatible with ONVIF CCTV and IP cameras that support RTSP, commonly used in security and surveillance systems.

## Description

- RTSP Stream Integration: Supports real-time video streaming from IP and CCTV cameras using RTSP.
- Threat Detection: Detects predefined threats (e.g., intruders, weapons, or dangerous movements) using deep learning models.
- Real-Time Alerts: Notifies administrators through live updates and alerts when a potential threat is detected.

  
## Getting Started

To set up the project and run it, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
OpenCV (for video processing)
RTSP-enabled IP/CCTV Camera (for testing)
